# Target-Practice-Game

This target practice game is a familiar shooting game where you have to aim and shoot a dartboard before it dismisses.

You will test your aiming capabilities and reflexes by clicking a changing dartboard. Try to hit as many as possible since if you reach five failures: Game over.

The dartboards will keep appearing and disappearing in aleatory positions and times, so you have to be prepared and focused hit them.

The aiming reticle will follow your mouse wherever you move it (it won't get out of the game window though).

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pygame.

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

If we want to play this game, we only need to install the pygame library and run the code. 

For the installation, refer to the "Installation" section.

The game will continue until we fail five times or click the exit button (the X above).


## Roadmap

Shortly, I will add both score and failure meters. I will also add background music and sound effects.
